# Graph-based Problems

## Introduction
This folder contains a collection of graph-based problems that I will be solving during the #100DaysOfCode challenge. The problems range from basic graph traversal problems to more complex ones involving algorithms like Dijkstra's, Prim's, Kruskal's, etc.

## Problem List
1. [Problem 1](./Problem1) - Basic Graph Traversal
2. [Problem 2](./Problem2) - Dijkstra's Algorithm
3. [Problem 3](./Problem3) - Prim's Algorithm
4. [Problem 4](./Problem4) - Kruskal's Algorithm
5. [Problem 5](./Problem5) - Graph Coloring

## Problem Format
Each problem is contained in its own folder and includes a README file with the problem description, input/output examples, and hints (if applicable).

## Solutions
Solutions to these problems can be found in the [Java](../Java) and [Python](../Python) folders.
